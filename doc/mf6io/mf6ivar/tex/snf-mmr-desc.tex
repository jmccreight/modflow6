\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that budget flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET SAVE FILE'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that calculated flows between cells will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control. If there is no Output Control option and ``PRINT\_FLOWS'' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress period.  This option can produce extremely large list files because all cell-by-cell flows are printed.  It should only be used with the MMR Package for models that have a small number of cells.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{iseg\_order}---segment calculation order

\item \texttt{mann\_n}---manning roughness coefficient

\item \texttt{seg\_depth}---Depth of bankfull water in segment

\item \texttt{seg\_slope}---surface slope of each segment

\item \texttt{x\_coef}---The amount of attenuation of the flow wave, called the Muskingum routing weighting factor; enter 0.0 for reservoirs, diversions, and segment(s) flowing out of the basin
